summary: 'I graduated in computer engineering from Dokuz Eylül University. Also, I graduated with 3.7 scores in Computer Programming from Mehmet Akif Ersoy University. I learned the fundamentals of algorithms and basic SQL at Mehmet Akif Ersoy University. I started with Java and Android. Then, I continued to search linux distros and I discovered Manjaro Linux. 
  I started to develop my works on Linux at this point. I can say that I love to works on Linux systems. Then, I wondered to develop a multi-platform application with my summer interview.
  So, I learned React-Native, Expo, Typescript etc. Python. I fall in love these technologies. At the same time, I did my homeworks with Python, R, Java.'
